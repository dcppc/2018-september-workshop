Team Copper is happy to reimburse transportation expenses, hotels, AirBnB,
and everything allowed by the [UC Davis travel policy](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/3420365/BFB-G-28) 
(since we will be using UC Davis to reimburse expenses for this meeting).

**All requests for reimbursement (other than mileage & parking meters)
must be accompanied by an itemized receipt.**

### Forms

### Meals
- **Save all of your receipts.** 
- Meals will only be reimbursed for the amount of actual expenses incurred (not to exceed $62 per day).
- There must be an overnight stay to claim meal reimbursement.
- The cost of alcohol will not be reimbursed. Meal receipts must be itemized and alcohol must be put on a separate receipt!
- The $62 daily limit includes all tips for meals. 

### Flights
- Please book your own flights. 
- Purchasing flights for colleagues is not allowed. Each attendee must purchase their own flight.
